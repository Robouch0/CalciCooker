# CalciCooker

CalciCooker is a game made for an Epitech GameJam project.

***It was made in two days by Venalette and Roboucho.***  üòé

The theme of this jam was "flame," so we made a little cooking game about burning some foods and some kitchen!

The main protagonist of the game is Calcifer. In professional reconversion, he finds his new job in a restaurant!

His job? He has to grill some nice skewers for the clients. Help him by putting the requested food on his order!

If you are too slow to send a command you will loose, and if your kitchen get devoured by Calcifer fire, you also loose :'S¬†
Try not to roast the food too hard. Calcifer may be angry at you!!


# Controls


You can simply *click* with your mouse in this game, you have to *click* the fire multiple times to extinguish them, you have to *click* and drag the ingredients to put them on the skewer.

You also have to *click* on the appearing arrow to turn the ingredients one time in the cooking process.
And lastly, you have to *click* on the dring dring to send out the command when they are well cooked on the skewer.

Try to survive, try to not get burned alive, try to please the client, and also, have fun!


# Assets


All of the assets are homemade and handmade by Venalette on Aseprite; of course, Calcifer is rightfully reserved by Ghibli Studio, as he is present in one of their movies.
cf¬†¬† ***"Howl's Moving Castle"***

As this project has no commercial purpose, we simply exercise our right to parody. We pay respect to the artists of Ghibli and their original masterpieces!¬†


# Code Part

As it was almost our first time coding in JS and using the p5.js library for a project, the code is really messy.¬†

And not well optimized.

But it's also because the time limit was really short !


But hey! It is what it is!


# Fun Fact


We also had some constraints or challenges for this jam, like adding things we have a passionate flame about (for us here, animation movies).

Adding the Olympic Flame of Paris 2024 (it is held by the little mascot plushie in red on the left corner of the kitchen)

And also some other things.. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
